This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data for different states across 515 days to explore various trends, predict future active cases, and investigate key metrics such as recovery rates.
The project focuses on examining the evolution of confirmed, recovered, and active COVID-19 cases while utilizing data science techniques like linear regression for prediction and correlation analysis for insights.

Key Objectives:
Detailed Trend Analysis of Confirmed Cases.
Visualize the progression of confirmed cases across states over time.
Identify trends, peaks, and plateaus in the data.
Investigate any significant periods of rapid increase or decline and link these with external factors such as government interventions.

Predicting Future Active Cases:
Predict the number of active COVID-19 cases for the next 10 days based on past data using linear regression.
Visualize predictions alongside actual data to evaluate accuracy.
Identify factors (e.g., government lockdowns, new variants) that could affect the predictions.

Examining the Relationship Between Confirmed and Recovered Cases:
Investigate the correlation between confirmed and recovered cases for specific states.
Use linear regression to model this relationship and calculate the correlation coefficient (RÂ²) to assess the strength of the relationship.

Recovery Rate Analysis:
Calculate the recovery rate for each state using the formula: Recovery Rate = (Recovered / Confirmed) * 100.
Rank states based on their recovery rates and visualize the differences using bar charts.
Identify trends or common factors among states with the highest and lowest recovery rates.

Tools & Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.
Scikit-learn: For building a linear regression model to predict future active cases and to perform correlation analysis.
Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab: For the execution of Python code and data exploration.

Steps Involved:
1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
The COVID-19 dataset is loaded and cleaned to ensure consistency and handle missing or invalid data (e.g., converting string values to numeric types).
The dataset includes daily counts of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases for various states.

2. Trend Analysis of Confirmed Cases:
Line plots are generated to visualize the evolution of confirmed cases for each state.
Key trends are identified, such as periods of rapid growth or stabilization, along with possible explanations like interventions or seasonal effects.

3. Prediction of Future Active Cases:
Active cases are calculated as: Active = Confirmed - Recovered - Deceased.
Linear regression is applied to predict the number of active cases for the next 10 days.
Predictions are plotted alongside actual case data to show expected trends.

4. Recovery Rate Calculation:
Recovery rates for each state are calculated, sorted, and visualized to highlight top and bottom performers.
Insights are drawn about possible reasons behind varying recovery rates, such as healthcare infrastructure, population density, or public health measures.

5. Results and Insights:
Confirmed Case Trends: This analysis uncovers key patterns such as surge periods where the cases rise rapidly, as well as phases where the spread slows down, possibly due to lockdowns or vaccination drives.
Prediction of Active Cases: The linear regression model provides a projection of active cases, allowing for short-term planning and decision-making.
Relationship Between Confirmed and Recovered: The correlation analysis reveals how closely recovered cases track confirmed cases, with insights into recovery speeds in different states.
Recovery Rate Analysis: States with higher recovery rates often share common factors like better healthcare facilities, faster response times, and effective containment measures, while lower recovery rates might indicate challenges in managing outbreaks.

Conclusion:
This project showcases how data analysis techniques can be applied to understand the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and make predictions. By calculating metrics such as recovery rates and predicting future trends, the analysis aids in better decision-making for public health policies.
